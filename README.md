Building the same API in different stacks to explore the world of backend
software development in 2021.

API and infrastructure development is still too hard in 2021. At least, that's
my theory. To test this theory, I'm going to build the the same, relatively
basic API in many different stacks.

I don't really know what I'm looking for. Maybe this is market research. Maybe
this is masochism ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è (I use this emoji too much)
